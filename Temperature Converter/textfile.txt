This app is to convert Temperature given in Celsius to Fahrenheit, and vice-versa

//NOTE//
•→ Two edit-text boxes are included in this programme and are used to collect user input in order to determine the temperature.
•→ The code will produce a toast message indicating "Please enter the value you want to convert" when both inputs are empty. 
•→ Otherwise, the programme shows a Toast with the message "Please enter only one value to convert" when both input fields are filled.
